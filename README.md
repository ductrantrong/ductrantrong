## 💼 EXPERIENCE

### **AI Engineer Team Lead** | Yabo Sports

_July 2023 - Current_

- **Fraud Detection System:** Designed a Kafka-integrated system processing raw transaction data. Built preprocessing pipelines for feature extraction (using PaddleOCR for images) and developed an ensemble of multi-modal models to predict fraudulent transactions.
- **Automated Trading Agent:** Built an agent utilizing tabular OHLC data with XGBoost and Freqtrade/FreqAI, enhanced by an integrated LLM for real-time news analysis.
- **Conversational Agents:** Developed chat agents powered by Google-ADK with tools for internet search, RAG, database query, and memory management (mem0), using Arize Phoenix for observability.
- **Search & Recommendation Engine:** Implemented an engine with LLM-driven structured extraction, embeddings, and semantic search for personalized recommendations.
- **Smart Edge Agents:** Developed speech-capable agents for low-power boards, utilizing a custom LiteLLM socket middleware for usage management and logging.
- **MLOps:** Built GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment; integrated MLflow for tracking and Portainer for resource management.

### **AI Engineer** | Hasaki

_August 2020 - June 2023_

- **Face Recognition System:** Designed an end-to-end pipeline with edge capture, Kafka streaming, and server-side recognition (alignment, record management).
- **Camera Analytics Pipeline:** Built a system for customer detection, tracking, counting, and heatmap generation using YOLO, managing the full lifecycle from data labeling to deployment.
- **Background Removal Pipeline:** Developed a U-Net based solution for background removal, covering data collection, training, and deployment.
- **Edge Applications:** Optimized applications on Jetson Nano and Orange Pi using source code encryption and GStreamer for secure transmission.
- **Model Optimization:** Applied quantization, pruning, TensorRT, ONNX, and Triton to enhance inference speed.
- **Backend Services:** Deployed scalable backend services using Flask and Gunicorn.
